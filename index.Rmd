##What is this? 

Hi! I'm Daniel, a sophomore CS/Stats student at Amherst College. This is a quick GitHub-hosted website, which I'm using to share data exploration and visualisation projects.

Main website: [here](danielnjoo.com)

<br>

##Current projects

* [icow](/data_investigations/icow/icow_exploration.html): relationships between certain country-level socio-economic variables and Date of Independence, ex-colonial ruler, etc.
* [shootings](/data_investigations/massshooting/massshooting.html): visualizing 5-years of violent shootings in the USA
